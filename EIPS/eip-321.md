description: creating a standard for contractId's and metadata at the smartcontract level

## Abstract


[erc-321](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/tree/master/ERCS/erc-321.md)proposes an interface for the tokenization of smart contracts, enabling their identification, management, and integration into marketplaces. It provides a systematic approach to creating contract instances with unique identifiers, managing ownership, and handling metadata to support the sale, purchase, and collection of smart contracts as assets.

## Motivation

With the advancement of blockchain technology and the proliferation of decentralized applications (dApps), there is a necessity for a protocol to manage smart contracts dynamically and interoperably. There is a requirement for a standardized mechanism that supports the tokenization, exchange, and aggregation of smart contracts. , [erc-321](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/tree/master/ERCS/erc-321.md) along with its ERC-321Metadata extension, aims to meet this need by offering a structured interface for smart contract lifecycle management within marketplaces.

## Specification
This EIP introduces a protocol for the tokenization of smart contracts, facilitating their identification, management, and integration into marketplaces. It outlines the creation of contract instances with unique identifiers, alongside ownership and metadata management, to support their sale, purchase, and collection.

## Motivation

The advancement of blockchain technology and the proliferation of decentralized applications (dApps) underscore the need for a dynamic, interoperable protocol for managing smart contracts. A standardized mechanism for tokenization, exchange, and aggregation is necessary. This EIP, with its ERC-321Metadata extension, proposes a structured interface for lifecycle management of smart contracts within marketplaces.


## Specification

**ERC-321 Interface:**

```solidity
interface IERC321Metadata is IERC321 {
    function tokenURI(uint256 contractId) external view returns (string memory);
}
```

## Rationale

This standard addresses the need for a systematic approach to smart contract tokenization, facilitating the safe sale and transfer of smart contracts on marketplaces. It lays the foundation for an acquisitions market and a legal framework for smart contract sales and trade.

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation provided demonstrates the application of this EIP in creating and managing tokenized smart contracts with unique identifiers and metadata.

## Security Considerations

Securing the implementation of [erc-321](https://github.com/ethereum/ERCs/tree/master/ERCS/erc-321.md) is crucial, focusing on managing contract ownership and metadata integrity. Adhering to smart contract security best practices and opting for decentralized storage solutions for metadata are essential to mitigate risks. It is also important to note that audits of the contracts or bytecode being deployed is important to ensure security in the children contracts.  

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-321 is designed with backward compatibility in mind, ensuring seamless interaction with existing ERC standards and the broader Ethereum ecosystem.
